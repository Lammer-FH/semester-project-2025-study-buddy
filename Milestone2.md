## Changes to the UI
- Added a "**?**" button so that the user can go back to the  welcome page (US1) (see Paperprototype.pdf in the docs folder of the Project)
- Based on the previous feedback (MS1) added descriptive text for the '**+**" button to mark explicitly its functionality (see updated Paperprototype.pdf)
- 

## Database Setup

This project includes a sample H2 database that mimics MySql database with test data.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository (sample database included)
2. Run the application: `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
3. Access H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
   - JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:file:./data/studybuddy_db`
   - Username: `studybuddy`  
   - Password: `studybuddy`

In the h2-console you can see the existing data and add new one, which will be reflected in the UI.
### Sample Data Included:
- Test user
- Sample courses, assignments, and tasks
